The app will quit 7 seconds after launching the game for the Steam version.
Content Catalog Check - Launches the ContentCatalog.txt checker. This runs automatically at startup but won't display anything unless an issue is found.

It will also overwrite any settings in StarfieldCustom.ini and deletes Starfield.CCC file if found. A warning will be displayed before any action is taken in case you accidently click this option.
The tool will not modify the INI files in the game folder, only the ones found in your Documents\My Games\Starfield folder.
